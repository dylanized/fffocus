This is a minimalist pomodoro timer. Here's how it works:

- Click the title and identify your next action
- Click the circle to start the timer. The default time is 25 minutes
- Click again to pause the timer, or double click to reset it
- If you navigate away from the page and come back, it will keep track of the elapsed time

You can set fffocus.com as your browser homepage, and have a constant reminder to stay on task.

More configuration options too:

- Double click to reset, then double click again to edit the timer duration
- In the lower left corner of the page, there is a secret button to change the button color

Happy fffocusing!
