This is a minimalist pomodoro timer. Here's how it works:

- Click the button to start the timer. The default timer duration is 25 minutes
- Enter the task for this sprint
- Click again to pause the timer, or double click to reset it
- If you navigate away from the page and come back, it will keep track of the elapsed time

You can set fffocus.com as your browser homepage, and have a constant reminder to stay on task.

More configuration options too:

- Click the task at any time to edit it
- Double click the button to reset the timer, then double click again to edit its duration
- In the lower left corner of the page, there is a secret link to change the button color
- Use a multi-browser setup? Point the secondary browser(s) to http://fffocus.com/blank
