This is a minimalist pomodoro timer. Here's how it works:

- click the title and identify your next action
- click the circle to start the timer. The default time is 25 minutes
- click again to pause the timer, or double click to reset it
- if you navigate away from the page and come back, it should keep track of the elapsed time

You can set fffocus.com as your browser homepage, and have a constant reminder to stay on task.

More configuration options too:

- after the timer is reset, double click it to edit the timer duration
- in the lower left corner of the page, there is a secret button to change the "on" color

The whole mini-app is driven by a static html page and a bunch of object-oriented Javascript, using Knockout.js, HTML5 local store, and some other goodies. Desktop only for now, also this is untested in IE.

Happy fffocusing!!
